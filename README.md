* `p2_ffs.ipynb`: Notebook for feature selection methods and analysis with probabilistic classifiers.
* `utils.py`: Utility functions used across notebooks.
* `data/`: Folder containing datasets.
* `img/`: Folder for storing images used in notebooks.
* `results/`: Folder for saving model results and outputs.
* `requirements.txt`: File containing all necessary Python libraries.

### Getting started

To run the notebooks, clone the repository and follow the following commands:

Set up the virtual environment:
```console
$ python -m venv env
```
Activate the virtual environment:
